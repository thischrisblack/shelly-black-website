I am very pleased to have my first journal article published in _Archival Science_. Its title is ["The implications of digital collection takedown requests on archival appraisal,"](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10502-019-09322-y) and I originally wrote this for a class I took with Professor Jamie Lee this past spring. It investigates how data privacy legislation, such as the right to be forgotten, and digital collection redaction requests affect the selection of materials in archives.
