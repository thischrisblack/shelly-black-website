I've grown to appreciate the soft images my digital pinhole yields. I decided to submit work to an exhibition in Downtown Tucson themed and titled Enlightenment.

As a photographer, “enlightenment” embodies the medium’s process: the moment light hits the film or CCD. These photographs were created through a pinhole, where light--unobstructed by a lens--directly lands on the image plane. Each painterly still life features a subject representing enlightenment as birth or awakening.
