June 12–September 7, 2017 Tucson International Airport Center Gallery

Flying in or out of Tucson this summer? Before you go through security or grab your luggage, stop by my new exhibition.

_Miracle Mile 1AM_ is a body of work that documents vintage neon motel signs in Tucson, Arizona. The Miracle Mile corridor was part of the cross-country Routes 80 & 89, the main artery for travelers before the construction of Interstate 10. The signs I photographed were recently renovated, and neon signage is best experienced at night. However, this part of town is not highly frequented during those hours. I used black and white film, a medium contemporary to the Automotive Age, and made these images to increase awareness of these cultural landmarks.

_The Center Gallery is located on the ticketing level, pre-security, between Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines. Construction is currently obscuring the entrance of the gallery, but you can still walk around it, past the Market Express & Bar. The Gallery is open to the public 24 hours a day._
