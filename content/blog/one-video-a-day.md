In 2014, I consciously made New Year's resolutions, and one of these included practicing gratitude. Every week, I would write down three things I was grateful for.  Somewhat replacing this exercise is one of my projects for 2015 (and beyond): taking a one-second video every day. I was inspired to do this after seeing a TED Talk by [Cesar Kuriyama](http://www.ted.com/talks/cesar_kuriyama_one_second_every_day), streamed at TEDx Tucson.

I actually started this in December, and since then, have noticed a few behavioral changes in myself:

-   Seeking photographic moments, _even when I'm not in the mood_
-   Also being aware of how the environment's sound will translate
-   Appreciating something every day
-   Feeling more inclined to do something interesting daily

Not only has this become a media exercise in gratitude, but it also serves as a diary, which I have not produced in years. Regardless of how cinematic, beautiful, technically-proficient or eclectic this "movie" becomes, it is exciting to know that in ten years, I will have one-hour long documentary of my life.
