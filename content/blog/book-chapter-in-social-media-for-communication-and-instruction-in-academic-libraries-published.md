I am excited to see my book chapter, ["Diversity and Inclusion: How to Avoid Bias and Social Media Blunders,"](https://repository.arizona.edu/handle/10150/631799) in print!

A few years ago, I started noticing many marketing, social media, and PR snafus related to racism and implicit bias. This happens in all industries and sectors, including libraries and archives. This led me to writing a chapter for *Social Media for Communication and Instruction in Academic Libraries* based on my experiences an as academic library marketer. I hope it encourages readers to be more socially aware when posting to social media and conscious of who is scrolling through their content.
