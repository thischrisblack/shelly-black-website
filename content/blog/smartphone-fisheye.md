Like the GoPro that I just tested, smartphone lens attachments are democratizing the photography toolkit for consumers and amateur photographers. For the price of lunch, I ordered the Photojojo Super Fisheye lens. I always wanted my own fisheye, but the glass for SLR cameras is a little expensive. This 235-degree wide phone lens attachment is just gratifying enough. My phone camera has trouble focusing and is poor in low light, but I enjoy using this fisheye lens--especially for selfies and videos!

I once scoffed at these attachments, thinking they were a lazy substitute for learning the effect of different focal lengths. But now I see the value of having this affordable equipment readily available to anyone. Coming from an analog background, it's sometimes hard to embrace change that technology and markets bring.
