The Asian-Pacific American Librarians Association is currently running a Bonfire t-shirt campaign. I'm very honored for the shirts to feature my design, which I submitted through their contest and members voted for.

The Bonfire shop offers unisex, slim-fit, long-sleeve, and children's t-shirts. The campaign lasts through February 25 and benefits APALA scholarships and other programs.
