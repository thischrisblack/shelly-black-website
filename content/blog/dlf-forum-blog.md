Attending conferences virtually is not the same as they are in person. However, the upside is that I've been able to participate in more events because travel is no longer a cost. One of these was the DLF Forum, which I attended as one of ten Community Journalists they selected. The awesome part was that not only was registration free, but I also received a scholarship to write about my experience for their [blog](https://www.diglib.org/dlf-forum-community-journalist-reflection-shelly-black/).
