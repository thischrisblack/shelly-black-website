Light painting fail galore! In half an hour, I couldn't do what a fifteen year-old photographer is able to do. Upon seeing [John Kraus](http://johnkrausphotos.com/)' light-painted signature with moon light, I was inspired to try it myself.

I wasn't successful with cursive, and I wanted to sleep that night, so I opted to just do my letters  in all-caps. The chicken scratches follow:

This is as good as my actual signature got. I was rather bummed that I couldn't intuitively grasp the inverted writing motion. (In high school history class, I wrote all my notes backwards, so that  a mirror was required to read them. These antics were inspired by da Vinci.)

Perhaps I will re-visit this long exposure moon photography . . .
