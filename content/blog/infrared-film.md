Before infared film is continued, I decided to shoot a roll on a trip to Yuma, Arizona. While the town is more known as a place that one passes through, I thought some of its features would be conducive to the dreamy qualities of infrared pictures.

I shot on Rollei 400 film, with a red 25 filter to help block the visible light. For most of my pictures, I compensated for the decrease in light by looking at the in-camera light reading, and increasing the exposure by two or three stops. This worked out great, as I didn't lose any frames!
