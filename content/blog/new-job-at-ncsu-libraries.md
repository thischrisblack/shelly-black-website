Even though there's a global pandemic occurring, I'm still thrilled for the next chapter in my life. After living in Arizona for 15 years, I'll be moving to Raleigh, North Carolina, to start a new job at North Carolina State University Libraries. I'll be the [2020-2022 Cyma Rubin Library Fellow](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/news/main-news/three-new-ncsu-libraries-fellows-begin-their-appointments-summer) where my home department will be the Special Collections Research Center. I'll also work on a strategic initiative ("Capturing the Experience of the NC State University Libraries’ High-Tech Spaces"). When I interviewed in February, I really enjoyed meeting everyone and seeing all their library spaces. It was just inspiring, and I'm so grateful for this opportunity.

_My last day at the UA Main Library._

I could've never imagined starting a new job or finishing an old job remotely. I haven't seen my current colleagues since March 13. Working at the University of Arizona Libraries for almost five years has been a formative experience, and I've met so many wonderful people here. The UA campus has been home to me through my undergraduate and graduate years. I recently packed up my office, where the calendars were still turned to March. It was eerie to be in the empty, renovated library!

I'll miss Arizona, but I can't wait to join NCSU Libraries.
