I'm so grateful and thrilled to have one of my photographs selected for inclusion in *[The Qualities of LIGHT: A View from the Archive](https://ccp.arizona.edu/exhibitions-events/exhibitions/qualities-light-view-archive-center-creative-photography)* at the Center for Creative Photography. It's on view December 14, 2019—May 9, 2020. Not only will my work be a part of that exhibit, but it will also be acquired as a part of their permanent collection. This is meaningful for multiple reasons.

-   The exhibition explores LIGHT Gallery, an influential contemporary photography gallery in New York City. It was the first to exhibit artists like Robert Mapplethorpe. Its first director was Harold Jones who would later become founding director of the CCP and start the University of Arizona photography program. As an undergraduate, I received mentorship from Harold and assisted him with outreach and event planning related to the UA photo alumni network.
-   My last year in college, I worked in the digitization department of the CCP, spending hours handling and scanning artwork by Diane Arbus, Andy Warhol, Marion Palfi, and more.
-   I also got up close with artwork having attended countless exhibits and print viewings. These experiences, along with lectures by photographers like Joel Peter Witkin, have been influential on my practice.
-   I also have fond memories of leisurely perusing the CCP library and finding books on topics not covered in my classes, like the history of Japanese photography.
-   As an alumna of the UA, where the CCP is located, it is an honor to to be included in archives on campus.
-   It is also an honor to have work in the same building as Robert Capa, Man Ray, Hiroshi Sugimoto, Richard Misrach, Eikoh Hosoe, and too many others to name.
