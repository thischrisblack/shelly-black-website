It started with a can of Shiner beer.

A DSLR camera can be turned into a pinhole camera in just a few minutes! Using a needle, I pierced a hole--no larger than half a millimeter--through a piece of aluminum from a beer can.  This sheet of metal was attached to a Nikon body cap which my husband drilled a hole through.

The resulting images are ethereal and very low contrast (straight from the camera). The ISO was cranked all the way up, and the exposures were a little long for hand-holding the camera. To obtain sharper images, I need to experiment with finessing the pinhole size.

I also experimented with the pinhole in video recording mode. The diffracted sunlight makes the clip even more dreamy.
