If you missed my _Miracle Mile 1AM_ images at the airport gallery last summer, check them out at Pima County Public Library. Through the month of June, I will be exhibiting them at [Kirk-Bear Canyon Library](https://www.library.pima.gov/locations/BCN/) in northeast Tucson. Then in January 2019, they will be at the [Joel D. Valdez Main Library](https://www.library.pima.gov/locations/MAI/) downtown.
