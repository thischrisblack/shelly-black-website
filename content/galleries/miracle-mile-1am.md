Miracle Mile 1AM is a body of work that documents vintage neon motel signs in Tucson, Arizona. The Miracle Mile corridor was part of the cross-country Routes 80 & 89, the main artery for travelers before the construction of Interstate 10. The signs I photographed were recently renovated, and neon signage is best experienced at night. However, this part of town is not highly frequented during those hours. I used black and white film, a medium contemporary to the Automotive Age, and made these images to increase awareness of these cultural landmarks. Having lived in multiple places, the timelessness of motels is a comfort for me. While I am drawn to these spaces for the transient, I also form a deeper connection to the Old Pueblo by reflecting on its past.
